# ConsoleProject

This is my very first successful project! I am trying to build my skills in c# programming and the best advice I got was to, well, program.
A calculator is a very simple project but it proves that I am knowledgeable of some of the basics of the c# language.
I will continue to build on this project as I continue learning new things about the language.
